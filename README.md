## GUIDES

# How to convert FNF charts to YA4KRG charts?
* Download Python 3.12.4 [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/python-3.12.4-amd64.exe) [MacOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/python-3.12.4-macos11.pkg)
* Download the YA4KRG source and open the converter folder
* Drag and drop your FNF chart json onto "fnftoya4krg.py"
* Profit.

# How to add custom songs and charts?

* Make a folder in the "charts" folder with your song name
* add the audio for the song and add it to the folder (IT HAS TO BE NAMED music.ogg!)
* make the chart or convert a fnf chart and add it to the folder
* copy the songInfo.json from test, paste it into your song folder and edit it
* add a "image.png" or "video.mp4" if you wanna have a custom background (If you're doing a video make sure it has no audio or remove the audio from it.)
* Profit.

# How to download songs from the online repo?

* Just open YA4KRGDLTool.exe (if windows) and choose a song to download, it'll automatically extract the song to the charts folder for ya!
* Mac & Linux instructions coming uhh soon
* Also feel free to fork the repo and add your own songs, I'll accept any PR!

# How to add mid-song events?

* Mid song events are handled via SScript (I would use base hscript but I'm dumb, also they're not implemented yet, you can only do the basics,)

* UNFINISHED LOL!
